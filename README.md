# oxford-comma-survey
For this project, I was tasked with creating a dashboard in Power BI with any data I wanted to use. With my background in public relations, I couldn't help myself and decided to use data from a 2014 survey that polled Americans about the Oxford Comma.

With this dashboard, I wanted to figure if Americans who are familiar with the Oxford Comma are more likely to use the Oxford Comma? And similarly, if they are familiar with the Oxford Comma, are they more likely to care about the proper use of the word 'data' as a singular or plural noun.
